This is where i put chromatics and stuff like that or sf2/fsts


If you want to make soundfonts out these credit me for the chromatic and link the github too

If your using any of these chromatics/sf2 for your covers now You have to link the chromatic collection in description somewhere

Sometimes the chromatics are in chromatics.txt same with soundfonts but they are in sf2.txt
